# Lithium

Free and open-source Minecraft mod which works to optimize many areas of the game in order to provide
better overall performance. It works on both the **client and server**, and **doesn't require the mod to be installed
on both sides**.

### What makes Lithium different?

One of the most important design goals in Lithium is *correctness*. Unlike other mods which apply optimizations to the
game, Lithium does not sacrifice vanilla functionality or behavior in the name of raw speed. It's a no compromises'
solution for those wanting to speed up their game, and as such, installing Lithium should be completely transparent
to the player.
